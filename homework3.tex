\item Adversary Arguments
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item We can determine an upper bound on the expected loss using the function derived in class.  For the purposes of this example, $L^*=\frac{T}{2}$ (that is, the best expert is wrong on at most half the days), $n=2$, $\epsilon = .5$, so we have
		\begin{align*}
			L &\leq \frac{ln n}{\epsilon} + (1 + \epsilon) L^* \\
			&\leq \frac{ln n}{.5} + (1 + .5)\frac{T}{2} \\
			&\leq 2 ln n + \frac{3T}{4}
		\end{align*}
	\item 
		\begin{align*}
			L &\leq \frac{ln n}{\epsilon} + (1 + \epsilon) L^* \\
			&\leq \frac{ln n}{\epsilon} + (1 + \epsilon)\frac{T}{2}
		\end{align*}
	\end{enumerate}
\item Multiplicative weights algorithm
The translated and scaled game payoff matrix for the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Cheat game described is as follows:
\[ \begin{array}{ccc}
0.5 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0.5 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0.5 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \]\\
Note that for the following I am 0-indexing the days. \\
The game strategy for day 10 :: $R = [.253, .329, .166, .253], C = [.727, .091, .182]$.  This is in $\delta$ equilibrium for $\delta = .213$.\\
The game strategy for day 100 :: $R = [.173, .326, .005, .497], C = [.604, .099, .297]$.  This is in $\delta$ equilibrium for $\delta = .050$.\\
The game strategy for day $\lceil 100 ln 4 \rceil$ :: $R = [.159, .333, .001, .507], C = [.621, .079, .3]$.  This is in $\delta$ equilibrium for $\delta = .041$.\\
\item Games and Application
\item Investing in Instruments \\
Let there be an adversary who is arranging the stockmarket against the deterministic investor.  The adversary knows the conditions under which a deterministic player will invest in a particular instrument, so he fulfills those conditions with at least one instrument $I$ and then causes that instrument to stop producing gains once invested in.  Since he is fulfilling the anticipated conditions with \emph{at least} one instrument, he need not violate the condition that at least one instrument earns at least $P$ dollars over $T$ days.
